# QuantumRNG a Node Package Manager [![Developing Time](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/6e3553f3-7d6a-4619-af68-505157a93d06/project/018c546b-0d0f-4ad0-8f0b-decd4b5eb52a.svg)](https://wakatime.com/badge/user/6e3553f3-7d6a-4619-af68-505157a93d06/project/018c546b-0d0f-4ad0-8f0b-decd4b5eb52a)

This project provides a quantum computing simulator written in JavaScript. It includes classes and methods for simulating quantum gates, circuits, teleportation, error-connection and more. The framework is designed to be modular and extendable, allowing users to experiment with quantum algorithms and simulations.

### Usage
To use the quantumrng, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies : `npm install`
2. Import the necessary classes and methods into your project : 

```js

const {
     QuantumState,
     QuantumCircuit,
     QuantumGate,
     QuantumTeleportation,
     QuantumErrorConnection,
     QuantumAlgorithm,
   } = require('quantum_rng');

```

### Benefits 

- Simulate quantum operations without the need for a physical quantum computer.
- Explore quantum algorithms and protocols in a controlled environment.
- Understand the principles of quantum teleportation, error correction, and more
